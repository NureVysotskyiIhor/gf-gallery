# EstateFlow Client

This repository contains the client-side code for **EstateFlow**. The frontend is built with **React**, styled with **Shadcn UI** and **Tailwind CSS**, uses **Zustand** for state management, and **Tanstack Router** for client-side routing. It communicates with the EstateFlow server via a RESTful API to provide a seamless user experience.
